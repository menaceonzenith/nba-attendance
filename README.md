# Predicting NBA Attendance with Linear Regression - Metis Project 2
## Rudy Wang

## Background:

Yes, I'm another one of the many NBA fans that wanted to pursue a project using basketball analytics. You can imagine my excitement slightly dip when I went on Google and did a quick search of "NBA Data Science Projects" and saw endless pages of the same, rote projects: Predicting MVP, Wins, or even the salaries of players, and many more. I found myself wanting to do something in the space that would be a bit outside of the box and different than the other established NBA topics online.

That's when the idea of predicting NBA attendance popped up. At the end of the day, the NBA organization is a business with a focus on making money for itself and despite viewership via television or cord-cutter apps, physical attendance garners the most money for teams as attendance goers snatch up merchandise, buys treats and drinks at the many venues within the stadium, and obviously the tickets to attend the game. 

Because every stadium has a different capacity, it would be difficult to compare the actual raw numbers of attendance among all stadiums. My focus shifted to predicting the % Filled at each stadium:

It would be interesting to see whether I could accurately predict what factors cause NBA attendance to be high or low - do team stats, amount of all-stars, or even city population have any influence on the attendance?

## Mission:

The initial thought was to see if there was any relationship on basic/advanced basketball stats with predicting NBA attendance at the varying stadiums. I would use web scraping and linear regression tools to accomplish my set out mission.

## Trust the Process:
