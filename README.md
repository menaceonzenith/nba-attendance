# Predicting NBA Attendance with Linear Regression - Metis Project 2
## Rudy Wang

## Background:

Yes, I'm another one of the many NBA fans that wanted to pursue a project using basketball analytics. You can imagine my excitement slightly dip when I went on Google and did a quick search of "NBA Data Science Projects" and saw endless pages of the same, rote projects: Predicting MVP, Wins, or even the salaries of players, and many more. I found myself wanting to do something in the space that would be a bit outside of the box and different than the other established NBA topics online.

Seeing how many linear regression projects are built upon 


To demonstrate a strong understanding for linear regression, I built a project to predict NBA attendance at the different arenas for the 30 teams of the NBA.
